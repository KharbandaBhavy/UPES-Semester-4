# UPES-Semester-4
- This repository belongs to the Fourth semester of my college.
- This semester contained a lot of important subjects like Database Management System, Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Data Communication and Network.
- This repo contains the codes for all the assignments, I got for these subjects.
- Happy Coding üßëüèª‚Äçüíª.....


## Database Management System üìÖ
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Database Management System folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Experiment-1: To understand the concept of designing issue related to the database with creating, populating the tables. Also familiarize students with different ways of manipulation in database.
- Experiment-2: To understand the concept of data constraints that is enforced on data being stored in the table. Focus on Primary Key and the Foreign Key.
- Experiment-3: To understand the concept of SQL Sub-Query in the Database management system.
- Experiment-4: To understand the use of inbuilt function and relational algebra with SQL query.
- Experiment-5: To understand the use of group by and having clause and execute the SQL commands using JOIN.
- Experiment-6: To understand the use and implementation of SQL views.
- Experiment-7: To understand the use and implementation of SQL indexes.
- Experiment-8: To understand the use and implementation of SQL sequences.
- Experiment-9: To understand and implement the basics of PL/SQL Programming.
- Experiment-10: To understand and implement the basics of functions and procedure in PL/SQL Programming

- Exp-1: Display your first and second name on the browser utilizing the raster grid system?
- Exp-2: Plot the line between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) using the line equation, y = mx+c, where x1 = last two digit of your roll no. y1 = x1 + 3 x2 = X1+ 10 y2 = y1 + 5
- Exp-3: Draw a line between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the DDA Algorithm. Also display all the obtained points on the console. Take below points x1 = last two digit of your roll no. y1 = x1 + 3, x2 = x1 + 9, y2 = y1 + 6
- Exp-4: Draw a circle with the help of Midpoint circle algorithm taking radius as the last digit of your roll. No. and the centre at (50,50)?
- Exp-5: Draw an ellipse with the help of midpoint algorithm with centre at (50,50) and major axis equal to the last digit of your roll no and minor axis equal to the second last digit of your roll no.
- Exp-6: Write the code to draw a Circle with any Naive approach with centre at (50, 50) and radius equal to the last digit of your roll no.
- Exp-7: Write the code to draw an Ellipse with any Naive approach with centre at (50,50) and major axis equal to the last digit of your roll no and minor axis equal to the second last digit of your roll no.
- Exp-8: Draw Line between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using Bresenham line algorithm. Also display all the obtained points on the console. Take below points x1 = last two digit of your roll no. y1 = x1 + 3 x2 = x1 + 9 y2 = y1 + 6
- Exp-9: Write a transformation method as per the last digit of your roll no. To implement the working of 2D Transformations.
- Exp-10: Write a modified transformation method as per the last digit of your roll no. To implement the working of 2D Transformations.
